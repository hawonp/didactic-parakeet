# CSE 511 Midterm 

## Objective
- Program a neuron model for both ANN and SNN in Python

## Installation
- Make a virtual environment
    `python -m venv .venv`

- Activate virtual environment
    `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Usage
- `lif.py` contains an implementation of the Leaky-Integrated-and-Fire Neuron Model. It plots the membrane potential of the neuron over time for a sine wave.
- `relu.py` contains an implementation of the ReLU activation function. It plots the ReLU output for a set of input values.
